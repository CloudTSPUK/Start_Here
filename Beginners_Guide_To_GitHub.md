##Introduction
The purpose of this guide is to provide an introduction to the core workflow associated with leveraging GitHub as a version control system. 

This particular guide illustrates a browser based workflow for interfacing with the GitHub website to achieve basic **[Git](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary#Git)** tasks. Being based on GitHub this guide does not leverage any specific local Git client(s). A Git client is used to interface with a Git version control server to retrieve, manage, track and eventually sync local repositories and file changes back to a Git server.

**The core workflow/principles outlined in this guide apply irrespective of whether you are directly interfacing with online Git servers such as GitHub or Visual Studio Team Services or if you are working offline via Git clients that interface with GitHub, Visual Studio Team Services or other Git based version control systems.**

Some of the dedicated Git clients include:
* [GitHub for Desktop]( https://desktop.github.com/) application.
* [Visual Studioâ€™s GitHub Extension]( https://visualstudio.github.com/) providing integrated Visual Studio tooling for GitHub. 
* [Git Command Line Interface](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

This guide visualises and, where appropriate, builds upon the official introductory GitHub Hello World guide found [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

This guide assumes you have GitHub.com account and Internet access, this is all that is needed to complete this guide. 

### 1. Log into [GitHub](https://github.com/)

### 2. Create a new [Repository](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary#repository)
The first step to creating any project or body of work when using Git is to create a new repository. 

Respositories can be created as being either Public or Private. 
* A Public repository is a repository that is discoverable and accessible by the entire GitHub community. 
* A Private repository is a repository that is not discoverable by the larger GitHub community. Induvidual users need to be given direct access to the repository in order to work with it. 

The process for creating a public repository with a README file in GitHub is as follows:

### 3. Create a [Branch](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary#branch)
As referenced in the official glossary a branch is a parallel version of a repository. This parallel verison represents a complete copy of a repository at the point in which the branch was created.

In almost all version control systems the first branch of a project is taken from what can be refered to as the master or trunk version of the source code/project items under source control. 

Subsequent branches can be made to either the master or indeed other branches. The motivation for creating a branch and the point in time in which a branch is taken will come down to either personal preference or a wider branching team or organisation agreed branching strategy.

Some guidance on branching strategies can be found [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb668955.aspx).

This guide will create a branch from the master of the new repository created above. A change wil then be made in this branch and not on the master.

### 4. Make and [commit](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary#commit) changes

### 5. Open a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary#pullRequest)
